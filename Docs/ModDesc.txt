[b]WARNING: this mod is a script-heavy mod. You may experience some performance impact, especially with a weak CPU. This mod is pushing the limits of the script engine.

[size=5]Usage[/size]

You‚Äôll find the new rowboat right behind the Imperial City Waterfront Shack for sale in the water with a for sale sign posted nearby.

The boat can be purchased from Sergius Verus at The Three Brothers Trade Goods in the Imperial City Market District for 500 gold. He also sells all three upgrades to the rowboat (Storage Chest, Lamp, and Rope Ladder) for 100 gold each.

Once the boat is purchased, activate the boat to learn the Row spell and open the boat menu.

To move the boat you can either select ‚ÄúAuto-row Forward‚Äù/‚ÄúAuto-row Backward‚Äù in the boat menu or cast the Row spell while standing on the boat. The Row spell costs 5 fatigue but 0 magicka. Cast it while sneaking to row backwards. Hold down the cast key to continuously move the boat.

The boat will automatically turn towards the direction you are looking in first-person mode or the direction your character is facing in third-person mode. This can be enabled/disabled with the ‚ÄúLock Heading‚Äù/‚ÄùUnlock Heading‚Äù toggle in the boat menu.

The boat will automatically detect it is about to collide with land or obstacles and stop the boat. The collision detection waits for 2 seconds at the start of rowing to allow you to clear the boat from any obstacles before starting detection again.

At any time you can cast the Row spell to summon the boat to your location with two methods: ‚ÄúSummon Boat‚Äù which tries to obey terrain and chooses the best location in front of you to place the boat. ‚ÄúPlace Boat Right Here‚Äù will do exactly that and place the boat right in front of you even if that is inside a hill or floating in-air. It may take a second or two for the boat to appear, especially if you are far away from the boat.

When the boat is not moving you can select the ‚ÄúDrag Boat‚Äù option in the boat menu to drag the boat along with you over land or water. You are pulling all 200 pounds of the boat so be prepared to be encumbered or ready those feather effects. If you would like to stop dragging the boat you can either: activate the boat and select ‚ÄúStop Dragging", cast the Row spell near the boat and select ‚ÄúStop Dragging‚Äù, drop the Rowboat from your inventory. While dropping the boat from your inventory works, you should try to avoid doing it too much since it creates new references in the game and may lead to save game bloat.

If purchased, the chest can be used to store loot as you travel by boat. It is marked non-respawning so should be safe to store items long-term.

If purchased, the lamp can be turned on and off by either: interacting with the lamp, choosing the ‚ÄúToggle Lamp‚Äù option in the boat menu, or casting a fire or frost spell on the lamp.

If purchased, the rope ladder will deploy when the boat is moving in the water and you fall overboard. Interact with it to sit down on the seat on the boat. Start rowing again to hide the ladder.

The seat on the boat which is included by default will only be operable when the boat is not moving.

There‚Äôs an in-game manual for the boat. At the end there is an appendix with instructions on how to tweak the boat parameters and a list of all the editable parameters. I've copied that section below here for reference within this spoiler tag:

[size=5]Known Issues / FAQ[/size]

[list]
[*][b]The collision detection sometimes triggers when you are in clear open water.[/b] Sometimes this can happen much more frequently in some problem locations (beneath some bridges) or at very low frame rates. There isn‚Äôt much I can do about this, so just try rowing again until you clear the area.
[*][b]The collision detection sometimes fails to trigger when it should.[/b] Particularly when rowing into cliff faces or objects in the water. You‚Äôll likely get pushed overboard if this happens which stops the boat. If the boat gets lost in terrain, you can use the Row spell to summon it back at your location.
[*][b]There‚Äôs sometimes a weird splashing sound and visual effect around the boat when it is moving.[/b]¬†That‚Äôs just the tiny invisible vampire that is preventing you from losing your boat in the terrain, don‚Äôt worry about it¬†Ôªøüòâ
[*][b]The row spell as a ‚ÄúDO NOT USE - Darkness‚Äù effect in addition to the script effect and damage fatigue effect.[/b] This is purely there to remove the annoying spell cast sound and visual effect when you are continuously casting it. It doesn‚Äôt actually do anything in the game.
[*][b]The boat is floating above/below the water in interiors.[/b] There‚Äôs currently no way to fix this since we can‚Äôt query a cell‚Äôs water level from scripts. Hopefully we‚Äôll eventually have an OBSE64 function to do this.
[*][b]Sometimes the boat doesn‚Äôt appear when summoned.[/b] I noticed there are a few problem locations where this can happen more frequently. If it does, try switching to summoning with the ‚ÄúPlace Boat Right Here‚Äù option instead.
[*][b]The ‚ÄúGet On Boat‚Äù menu option sometimes places you outside the boat.[/b] This seems to be a bug/quirk with the game engine where it just decides to place the player slightly off of the position requested. If this ever happens, use the ‚ÄúSit Down‚Äù option or activate the rope ladder if you have purchased it which doesn‚Äôt have this problem.
[*][b]The seat on the boat doesn‚Äôt work when the boat is moving.[/b] The seat is intentionally disabled while the boat is moving because the game engine doesn‚Äôt allow moving a player that is seated.
[*][b]Followers fall off the boat.[/b] It seems like the game engine is better about keeping the player on the boat than other actors. I‚Äôm looking into better solutions for this.

[size=5]Compatibility[/size]

This mod should be fully compatible most mods. Let me know if you find a mod that isn‚Äôt compatible. In the future, this may need patches with any mods that modify:

[list]
[*]The area behind the IC Waterfront Shack where the rowboat is placed
[*]Sergius Verus or The Three Brothers Trade Goods
[*]Any model replacers for the rowboat, lower-class chest, lower-class stool, ship lamp, or rope ladder.
[*]The Darkness Spell Effect that‚Äôs unused in vanilla oblivion
[*]The VampireRace that‚Äôs unused in vanilla oblivion
[/list]
This mod was designed specifically with the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2118]Lived In - Imperial Waterfront mod[/url]¬†in mind, so it is compatible with that.
